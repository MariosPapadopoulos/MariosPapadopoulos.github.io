I am an early-stage researcher in computer vision and medical imaging, with a particular focus on Whole Slide Images (WSIs).
My work involves exploring and leveraging foundation models for digital pathology tasks and developing novel approaches in Multiple Instance Learning and Self-Supervised Learning.

I am currently affiliated with Imperial College London, where I develop approaches in digital pathology problems.
